# tutorials for JavaScript
JavaScript is Everywhere. Millions of web pages are built on JavaScript and it’s not going anywhere at least for now. On one side HTML and CSS give styling to the web pages but on the other side, it’s the magic of JavaScript that makes your web page alive. Today this language is not just limited to your web browser. You can also use it for server-side applications. Isn’t it cool to use a single language for both client-side and server-side applications? A single language fulfills both of the purposes and this is the main reason TON of job posting is there for javascript developers in the tech industry. 
According to Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019, JavaScript is the #1 programming language. The language is widely used by 95% of all the websites Whether it’s a small startup or a big company, most of them are working on some kind of website or an app that requires a good knowledge of this language. A lot of frameworks and libraries are there for javascript. These frameworks and libraries can be easily learned if your javascript fundamentals are clear. A lot of concepts are confusing and overwhelming for developers but a good knowledge of these concepts will help you in the long run. Frameworks and libraries come and go but the fundamentals always remain the same. It’s easy to build any kind of application and learn any framework and libraries if the fundamentals are clear. Also, it will help you in interviews as well. Let’s discuss some of the basic concepts of javascript which are important to learn for any JavaScript developer.

Local Scope allows access to everything within the boundaries (inside the box)
Global Scope is everything outside the boundaries (outside the box). A global scope can not access a variable defined in local scope because it is enclosed from the outer world, except if you return it.
Example: The code given below will give you an error because “name” is defined within the boundary (local scope) of the showName() function. You can not have access to this variable outside the function.

Is JavaScript very easy?

JavaScript is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language as compared to other languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python. It is a high-level, interpreted language that can easily be embedded with languages like HTML.

# JavaScript took just 10 days to develop.
JavaScript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich for use with the Netscape 2 browser. The original name for JavaScript was Mocha. In my opinion, I’ve gotten a few too many questions from non-programmers confusing JavaScript and Java, so maybe Mocha would have been the right call.

# JavaScript was probably named after Java.
JavaScript is about as similar to Java as a hamburger is similar to ham. But, there used to be support for running Java in the browser by way of Java “applets”. This technology is now completely deprecated, but at the time, it likely made more sense to piggy-back off the popularity of Java for the sake of widespread adoption.

# GitHub says JavaScript is the Most Popular language in the world.
According to https://octoverse.github.com/, JavaScript has been the most widely used language across GitHub repositories since 2014, when this statistic was first tracked. Here’s a few reasons why that may be:

# JavaScript is the de facto standard for building websites, and websites are essential for virtually any organization.
JavaScript is commonly taught and fairly easy to learn, making it popular among developers.
The heavily client-side nature of the language makes JavaScript repositories likelier to be open-source, potentially skewing the rankings away from large, private, enterprise-style projects.
# JavaScript is responsible for Web2, precursor to Web3
Maybe you’ve heard of Web3, the idea of a blockchain-enabled class of distributed web applications that will take over the world. Whether or not you believe in this technology, it’s worth knowing that the predecessor to Web3 is merely bidirectional site communication (Web2). Effectively, this means sites and apps that can communicate back and forth with a server, and potentially across other sites. And, of course, we have JavaScript’s “Ajax” requests to thank for popularizing this pattern.

# JavaScript has many implementations, but a single “owner”: ECMA
You may have heard of “ECMAScript” or ES6 (a.k.a. ECMAScript 6), but did you know that ECMA is responsible for governing and maintaining the language specification? In other words, all of the crazy JavaScript syntax we know and love is attributable to ECMA, “a Swiss based not-for-profit association”. The highest-ranked members of this association are representatives from:

Facebook
Google
Hitachi
IBM
Microsoft
Paypal
So these companies have a lot of say in the direction of the language.

# In reality, there is no longer one “true” JavaScript.
Despite all the organization done by ECMA, there have been many use cases added to JavaScript that aren’t officially part of the language spec. For example, React.js and other libraries use JSX syntax, which adds syntactic sugar for defining UI components. TypeScript is also a superset of the JavaScript language. It adds typing features designed to reduce the likelihood of type errors. While such features may not officially be part of the language, there are “transcompilers” like Babel that exist for translating them back into official, ES6 JavaScript to be run in the browser, server, or another application.
