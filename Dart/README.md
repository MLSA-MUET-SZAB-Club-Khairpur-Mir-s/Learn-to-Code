Dart is a descendant of the ALGOL language family, alongside C, Java, C#, JavaScript, and others. The method cascade syntax, which provides a syntactic shortcut for invoking several methods one after another on the same object, is adopted from Smalltalk.

Dart is an open-source general-purpose programming language. It is originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by ECMA. Dart is a new programming language meant for the server as well as the browser. Introduced by Google, the Dart SDK ships with its compiler –- the Dart VM. The SDK also includes a utility -dart2js, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script. This tutorial provides a basic level understanding of the Dart programming language.

Dart is the client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language for multi-platform development, Paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.

Dart also forms the foundation of Flutter. Dart provides the language and runtimes that power Flutter apps, but Dart also supports many core developer tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing code.

Dart offers sound null safety, meaning that values can’t be null unless you say they can be. With sound null safety, Dart can protect you from null exceptions at runtime through static code analysis. Unlike many other null-safe languages, when Dart determines that a variable is non-nullable, that variable is always non-nullable. If you inspect your running code in the debugger, you’ll see that non-nullability is retained at runtime (hence sound null safety).

The following code sample showcases several Dart language features, including libraries, async calls, nullable and non-nullable types, arrow syntax, generators, streams, and getters. To find examples of using additional Dart features, see the samples page. To learn more about the language, take the Dart language tour.

Dart has a rich set of core libraries, providing essentials for many everyday programming tasks:
Built-in types, collections, and other core functionality for every Dart program (dart:core)
Richer collection types such as queues, linked lists, hashmaps, and binary trees (dart:collection)
Encoders and decoders for converting between different data representations, including JSON and UTF-8 (dart:convert)
Mathematical constants and functions, and random number generation (dart:math)
File, socket, HTTP, and other I/O support for non-web applications (dart:io)
Support for asynchronous programming, with classes such as Future and Stream (dart:async)
Lists that efficiently handle fixed-sized data (for example, unsigned 8-byte integers) and SIMD numeric types (dart:typed_data)
Additionally, third-party publishers and the broader community publish thousands of packages, with support for features like these:
