Dart is an open-source general-purpose programming language. It is originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by ECMA. Dart is a new programming language meant for the server as well as the browser. Introduced by Google, the Dart SDK ships with its compiler –- the Dart VM. The SDK also includes a utility -dart2js, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script. This tutorial provides a basic level understanding of the Dart programming language.

Dart is the client-optimized language for developing fast apps on any platform. Its goal is to offer the most productive programming language for multi-platform development, Paired with a flexible execution runtime platform for app frameworks.

Languages are defined by their technical envelope—the choices made during development that shape the capabilities and strengths of a language. Dart is designed for a technical envelope that is particularly suited to client development, prioritizing both development (sub-second stateful hot reload) and high-quality production experiences across a wide variety of compilation targets (web, mobile, and desktop).

Dart also forms the foundation of Flutter. Dart provides the language and runtimes that power Flutter apps, but Dart also supports many core developer tasks like formatting, analyzing, and testing code.

Dart offers sound null safety, meaning that values can’t be null unless you say they can be. With sound null safety, Dart can protect you from null exceptions at runtime through static code analysis. Unlike many other null-safe languages, when Dart determines that a variable is non-nullable, that variable is always non-nullable. If you inspect your running code in the debugger, you’ll see that non-nullability is retained at runtime (hence sound null safety).

The following code sample showcases several Dart language features, including libraries, async calls, nullable and non-nullable types, arrow syntax, generators, streams, and getters. To find examples of using additional Dart features, see the samples page. To learn more about the language, take the Dart language tour.

Dart has a rich set of core libraries, providing essentials for many everyday programming tasks:
Built-in types, collections, and other core functionality for every Dart program (dart:core)
Richer collection types such as queues, linked lists, hashmaps, and binary trees (dart:collection)
Encoders and decoders for converting between different data representations, including JSON and UTF-8 (dart:convert)
Windows integration
SQLite
compression
