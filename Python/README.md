# Basic deep learning Phython tutorials
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.

Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.
A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.

Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.
GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.

It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.

It supports automatic garbage collection.

It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.

# Why is it called ‘Python’?

While many people assume the name Python Programming comes from something related to the Python snake, it actually comes from the TV comedy series ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus.’ This series broadcast on the BBC channel in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and was a favorite of Guido Van Rossum’s. Because it was short, cryptic, and included the name of his favorite TV comedy show, he chose the name ‘Python.’
i love this programming language
What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.
What can Python do?
Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
Why Python?
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
Good to know
The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
# 1. Why is it called ‘Python’?
While many people assume the name Python Programming comes from something related to the Python snake, it actually comes from the TV comedy series ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus.’ This series broadcast on the BBC channel in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and was a favorite of Guido Van Rossum’s. Because it was short, cryptic, and included the name of his favorite TV comedy show, he chose the name ‘Python.’


# 2. Poem Written about Python Programming
Believe it or not, a man named Tim Peters composed a poem called ‘The Zen of Python’ about Python programming. Simply type ‘import this’ into an interpreter to read this poetry.It’s a fascinating and entertaining poetry that you should read for yourself.


# 3. Python has overtaken French in primary schools
Doesn’t this one sound funny? Believe it or not, Python surpassed French as the most popular primary school language in 2015. Statistics show that 60% parents would prefer their children to learn Python than French. This shows that the importance of Python programming was acknowledged by a vast number of people. According to the same figures, 75 % of children in primary school would rather learn how to manage a robot than learn French.


# 4. There are C and Java Variants in Python
Python offers variations for the C and Java programming languages, despite being a self-contained programming language. The C derivative, known as CPython, was built to give Python the benefits of C. One of these criteria is performance. The variation can be used as an interpreter as well as a compiler.

Jython is Python’s Java implementation. It allows some of Java’s most important features, such as productivity, to run on a virtual machine.


# 5. Python does not require a compiler
Python is a high-level, interpreted language that does not require a compiler, unlike other programming languages such as Java and C++.Python code is stored in a .pyc file, which serves as the Python engine and eliminates the need for a compiler.


# 6. Python is one of Google’s official programming languages
Python is one of the few programming languages that has been designated as an official Google language. Python became one of Google’s official programming languages due of its efficiency. It was advantageous to them because it is simple to use, even on large projects. Even YouTube is powered by Python programming.


# 7. Python is similar to English
Many people claim that Python is a simple language to learn. The fundamental reason for this claim is that Python is more similar to English than other programming languages. It’s simple to figure out what each line of code accomplishes. Everything is simple and straightforward.


# 8. Wide range of aspects
Python is a general-purpose programming language. In fact, it can be used in a wide range of coding scenarios like web development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, internet of things and many more.
