History of Java

James Gosling OC is a Canadian computer scientist, best known as the founder and lead designer behind the Java programming language.
The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced technology for the digital cable 
television industry at the time. The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance,
Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995.
James Gosling and his team members started the project in the early '90s.

Following are given significant points that describe the history of Java.
1) James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. The small team of sun engineers called Green Team.
2) Initially it was designed for small, embedded systems in electronic appliances like set-top boxes.
3) Firstly, it was called "Greentalk" by James Gosling, and the file extension was .gt.
4) After that, it was called Oak and was developed as a part of the Green project. In 1995, Oak was renamed as "Java" because it was already a trademark byOak Technologies.
5) The team gathered to choose a new name. The suggested words were "dynamic", "revolutionary", "Silk", "jolt", "DNA", etc.According to James Gosling,
"Java was one of the top choices along with Silk". Since Java was so unique, most of the team members preferred Java than other names.
6) Java is an island in Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called Java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by
James Gosling while having a cup of coffee nearby his office.
7) Java was initially developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which is now a subsidiary of Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.
