What is Java?
Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
It is  simple programming langauage  
In this language support object oriented 
It is used for:

Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web servers and application servers
Games

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.uably feels more and more dated.

I can't tell you whether or not you should learn the Java programming language as of 2022. But I can tell you three reasons why Java still matters, and three reasons why it may be a slowly dying language.

Why Java Is Still Relevant
Let's start with the advantages that Java enjoys in the world of modern programming.


2. Java runs anywhere
Part of the reason why Java became so popular when it debuted in the 1990s was that it's a very platform-independent language. Typically, you don't have to change your code much at all to get the same Java program to run on Windows and Linux, for example.

This advantage makes Java a strong contender as a general-purpose programming solution. Although newer languages (like Go) are also relatively platform-independent, Java arguably remains the gold standard of programming languages that let you write your code once and run it anywhere.

3. Java is very modular

Another factor that drove Java's popularity when it appeared decades ago was its heavy focus on modularity. Although Java certainly wasn't the first object-oriented language, it was probably the first one to become massively popular.

Java's modularity and object-oriented architecture remain selling points for the language today because they make Java a good solution for developers who want to reuse code across a business. Java makes it especially easy to avoid having to build each new app from the ground up, and instead borrow from existing codebases to create new ones faster.

Why You (Maybe) Shouldn't Learn Java Programming Language
On the other hand, you can make a cogent argument for why Java is increasingly not worth learning.

1. Java is becoming less popular
First and foremost, Java seems to be slipping slowly in popularity. For years, it was the most popular language, but it's now in third place. This means that, over time, fewer and fewer new applications are likely to be written in Java.


That doesn't mean, of course, that Java is going away. On the contrary, as noted, it's likely that businesses across the world will need Java programmers for decades to come to maintain legacy codebases.

The reason why is that we live in a software-defined world. Today, virtual machines, containers, and cloud services make it easy to run an application wherever you want, without worrying about the underlying environment configuration.

In other words, you don't have to change your code to make your app work where you need it to work. You can change the hosting environment instead.

This isn't to say that application portability no longer matters. It's just not as critical as it used to be, and that makes Java a bit less important by extension.

3. Java is not simple
Java may be easy to learn, but it's not simple.

The language is easy to learn because Java code is straightforward to write, organize, and compile. But it's not simple because code written in Java tends to be more verbose and more tedious to write. You also have to compile it, which makes Java much less convenient than languages like Python.

So, if you're a college student learning to code for the first time, Java can be a good language to start with. If you're a professional who wants to churn out simple, elegant code and deploy it quickly, Java is not the ideal choice.

Conclusion
It's very unlikely that Java will disappear anytime soon. It remains far too deeply embedded into the programming culture and codebases to be nearing its demise.

Still, Java is not the obvious, go-to, general-purpose programming language that it was back in the late 1990s or 2000s. Arguably, Java's heyday has passed, and it only makes sense to learn the Java programming language today if you have specific goals — like getting a job where you'll maintain legacy Java codebases, or gaining an introduction to 
As of September 2022, Java 19 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions.

Dart is an open-source general-purpose programming language. It is originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by ECMA. Dart is a new programming language meant for the server as well as the browser. Introduced by Google, the Dart SDK ships with its compiler – the Dart VM. The SDK also includes a utility -dart2js, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script. This tutorial provides a basic level understanding of the Dart programming language.


# Some interesting facts that all programmers should know about Java
Java, the long-lasting programming language, remains immensely popular and for many good reasons. In fact, many programmers swear by the stability of Java.

# Java is the go-to language for millions of software developers. Java emerged as a tech juggernaut because of its unique portability and its capability of operating similarly on any hardware or operating system.

It’s secure, simple and robust, so with these attractive qualities in mind, here are some facts about Java which you probably did not know


# Java was called Oak at the beginning
The original name for Java was Oak. Java legend has it that a big oak tree that grew outside the developer James Gosling’s window.
It was eventually changed to Java by Sun’s marketing department when Sun lawyers found that there was already a computer company registered as Oak.
Another legend has it that Gosling and his gang of programmers went out to the local cafe to discuss names and wound up naming it Java.
There seems to be some truth in this as the “0xCafeBabe” magic number in the class files was named after the Cafe where the Java team used to go for coffee.

# Java was invented by accident
James Gosling was working at Sun Labs, around 1992. Gosling and his team were building a set-top box and started by “cleaning up” C++ and wound up with a new language and runtime. Thus Java or Oak came into being

# It pays to learn Java
The median salary of a Java developer is $83,975.00. Yes, it pays to be a Java developer and programmers are milking it. There are about 9 million Java developers in the world.

# Java is the second most popular language after C
Though many would argue that Java is all time favorite among developers, it is second most popular programming language after C.

Java is ranked #2 in popularity among programming languages, according to the programming languages popularity tracking website, tiobe.com.

# JUnit Testing Framework
The JUnit Testing Framework is currently the top used Java technology.

Its stability and popularity can be deduced from the fact that almost 4 out of 5 Java developers or 70 % developers out there used JUnit Testing Framework.

# Java is the go-to tool for enterprises
95 percent of enterprises use Java for programming. That is hell lot more than C and other languages put together.

# Current Java version
Java’s latest major release is the Platform Standard Edition 8. Its features include improved developer productivity and app performance through a reduced boilerplate code, improved collections, and annotations.

# The Duke
The Java mascot, ‘The Duke’ was created by Joe Palrang. Palrang is the same guy who has worked on the Hollywood blockbuster, Shrek.

# Java and Android
Java practically runs on 1billion plus smartphones today because Google’s Android operating system uses Java APIs.

# Final is not final in Java
Final actually has four different meanings in Java.

1) final class- The class cannot be extended

2) Final method- the method cannot be overridden

3) final field- The field is a constant

4)final variable- the value of the variable cannot be changed once assigned
