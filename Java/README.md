What is Java?
Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
It is  simple programming langauage  
In this language support object oriented 
It is used for:

Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web servers and application servers
Games

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.uably feels more and more dated.

I can't tell you whether or not you should learn the Java programming language as of 2022. But I can tell you three reasons why Java still matters, and three reasons why it may be a slowly dying language.

Why Java Is Still Relevant
Let's start with the advantages that Java enjoys in the world of modern programming.


2. Java runs anywhere
Part of the reason why Java became so popular when it debuted in the 1990s was that it's a very platform-independent language. Typically, you don't have to change your code much at all to get the same Java program to run on Windows and Linux, for example.

This advantage makes Java a strong contender as a general-purpose programming solution. Although newer languages (like Go) are also relatively platform-independent, Java arguably remains the gold standard of programming languages that let you write your code once and run it anywhere.

3. Java is very modular

Another factor that drove Java's popularity when it appeared decades ago was its heavy focus on modularity. Although Java certainly wasn't the first object-oriented language, it was probably the first one to become massively popular.

Java's modularity and object-oriented architecture remain selling points for the language today because they make Java a good solution for developers who want to reuse code across a business. Java makes it especially easy to avoid having to build each new app from the ground up, and instead borrow from existing codebases to create new ones faster.

Why You (Maybe) Shouldn't Learn Java Programming Language
1. Java is becoming less popular
First and foremost, Java seems to be slipping slowly in popularity. For years, it was the most popular language, but it's now in third place. This means that, over time, fewer and fewer new applications are likely to be written in Java.
That doesn't mean, of course, that Java is going away. On the contrary, as noted, it's likely that businesses across the world will need Java programmers for decades to come to maintain legacy codebases.
This isn't to say that application portability no longer matters. It's just not as critical as it used to be, and that makes Java a bit less important by extension.

3. Java is not simple
Java may be easy to learn, but it's not simple.

The language is easy to learn because Java code is straightforward to write, organize, and compile. But it's not simple because code written in Java tends to be more verbose and more tedious to write. You also have to compile it, which makes Java much less convenient than languages like Python.

So, if you're a college student learning to code for the first time, Java can be a good language to start with. If you're a professional who wants to churn out simple, elegant code and deploy it quickly, Java is not the ideal choice.

Conclusion
It's very unlikely that Java will disappear anytime soon. It remains far too deeply embedded into the programming culture and codebases to be nearing its demise.

Still, Java is not the obvious, go-to, general-purpose programming language that it was back in the late 1990s or 2000s. Arguably, Java's heyday has passed, and it only makes sense to learn the Java programming language today if you have specific goals — like getting a job where you'll maintain legacy Java codebases, or gaining an introduction to 
As of September 2022, Java 19 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions.

Dart is an open-source general-purpose programming language. It is originally developed by Google and later approved as a standard by ECMA. Dart is a new programming language meant for the server as well as the browser. Introduced by Google, the Dart SDK ships with its compiler – the Dart VM. The SDK also includes a utility -dart2js, a transpiler that generates JavaScript equivalent of a Dart Script. This tutorial provides a basic level understanding of the Dart programming language.
