It Will be Easy To Understand for beginners.

#3Is C++ easy for beginners?
C++ is hard to learn because of its multi-paradigm nature and more advanced syntax. While it's known to be especially difficult for beginners to learn, it's also difficult for programmers with no experience with low-level languages.
C++ is good for learning DSA
data structure can be easily understand by using C++ language

C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.
C++ introduces Object-Oriented Programming, not present in C. Like other things, C++ supports the four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance. C++ got the OOP features from Simula67 Programming language
As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

Why to Learn C++
C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:

C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.

C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.

C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.

C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.

C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.

There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.
