# Deep learning Tutroials basic importants points for c++
this  is very helpfull and intersted tutorial on c++
it is basic language of program you can also used in electronic projects .



It Will be Easy To Understand for beginners.

#3Is C++ easy for beginners?
C++ is hard to learn because of its multi-paradigm nature and more advanced syntax. While it's known to be especially difficult for beginners to learn, it's also difficult for programmers with no experience with low-level languages.
C++ is good for learning DSA
data structure can be easily understand by using C++ language

C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.
C++ introduces Object-Oriented Programming, not present in C. Like other things, C++ supports the four primary features of OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction, and inheritance. C++ got the OOP features from Simula67 Programming language
As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
Difference between C and C++
What is C++?
C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.

The language was updated 4 major times in 2011, 2014, 2017, and 2020 to C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20.

Why Use C++
C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.

C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.

C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.

C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.

C++ is fun and easy to learn!

As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.

Difference between C and C++
C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.

The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.

# What is C++ most known for?
C++ (or “C-plus-plus”) is a general-purpose programming and coding language. C++ is used in developing browsers, operating systems, and applications, as well as in-game programming, software engineering, data structures

# Benefits of C++
Object-Oriented: C# is designed around the principles of OOP, which means it supports the creation of objects, classes, and inheritance.

Type Safety: C# enforces strict type checking at compile-time, which helps catch errors early in the development process.

Memory Management: C# uses automatic memory management through a garbage collector, making it easier for developers to manage memory without worrying about memory leaks.

Platform Independence: C# applications can run on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux (through .NET Core and .NET 5+), and macOS.

Modern Language Features: C# continues to evolve with the addition of new features, such as async/await for asynchronous programming and pattern matching.

Rich Standard Library: C# benefits from the extensive .NET Framework (Windows) and .NET Core/.NET 5+ (cross-platform) libraries, which provide pre-built functionality for various tasks.

Used in Various Applications: C# is commonly used in developing a wide range of software, including desktop applications, web applications (ASP.NET), mobile apps (Xamarin), and games (Unity game engine).

Integration with Microsoft Ecosystem: C# integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft technologies like Visual Studio (an integrated development environment) and Azure (Microsoft's cloud computing platform).

# why to learn c++?
c++ is one of the standard languages within back-end development. It's an extremely fast and efficient language. Many tools and frameworks rely on the speed and efficiency of C++.
