# Basic deep learning tutorials importants points of C#
C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO).
C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.
C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level languages on different computer platforms and architectures.
The following reasons make C# a widely used professional language âˆ’
Although C# constructs closely follow traditional high-level languages, C and C++ and being an object-oriented programming language. It has strong resemblance with Java, it has numerous strong programming features that make it endearing to a number of programmers worldwide.
Boolean Conditions
Conditional Compilation
Simple Multithreading
LINQ and Lambda Expressions
C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.
What is C#?
C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".

It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 10, was released in November 2021.

C# is used for:

Mobile applications
Desktop applications
Web applications

C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It was introduced in the early 2000s as a part of the .NET framework. C# is designed for building Windows applications, web applications, and services. It is a versatile language that can be used for various types of software development.

Key features of C# include:

Object-Oriented: C# follows the principles of object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create reusable and modular code.

Type-Safe: C# is a statically-typed language, meaning that variable types are known at compile-time, reducing the chance of runtime errors.

Garbage Collection: Memory management in C# is handled by a garbage collector, which automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.

Platform Independence: C# applications can run on the Microsoft .NET framework, making them platform-independent to some extent. With technologies like .NET Core and .NET 5, C# applications can run on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Integration with .NET Framework: C# is closely integrated with the .NET framework, providing access to a rich set of libraries and tools for building different types of applications.
