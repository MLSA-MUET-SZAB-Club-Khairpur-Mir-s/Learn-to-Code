# Basic deep learning tutorials importants points of C#
C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO).
C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.
C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level languages on different computer platforms and architectures.
The following reasons make C# a widely used professional language −
Although C# constructs closely follow traditional high-level languages, C and C++ and being an object-oriented programming language. It has strong resemblance with Java, it has numerous strong programming features that make it endearing to a number of programmers worldwide.

Asynchronous Programming: C# supports asynchronous programming, enabling the creation of responsive and scalable applications.

Ease of Learning: Its syntax is intuitive and similar to other C-style languages, making it relatively easy for developers to learn and adopt.

C# has gained popularity in software development due to its versatility, developer-friendly syntax, and strong support from Microsoft, making it a valuable tool for building a wide variety of applications.

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

Object-Oriented: C# is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it supports concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Type-Safe: C# is a statically typed language, which means variable types are checked at compile-time, reducing runtime errors.

C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.
What is C#?
C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".

It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 10, was released in November 2021.

C# is used for:

Mobile applications
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web services
Web sites
Games
VR
Database applications
And much, much more










C# is a versatile and powerful programming language, widely used for developing a variety of applications, including web, desktop, and mobile, due to its strong type system, excellent performance, and seamless integration with the .NET framework. Its syntax is intuitive and efficient, making it a favorite among developers for creating robust and scalable software solutions.
