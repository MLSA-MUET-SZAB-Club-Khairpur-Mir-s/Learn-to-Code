# C# or C sharp
# Basic deep learning tutorials importants points of C#

C# is pronounced "C-Sharp". It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO).
C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.
C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level languages on different computer platforms and architectures.
The following reasons make C# a widely used professional language −
Although C# constructs closely follow traditional high-level languages, C and C++ and being an object-oriented programming language. It has strong resemblance with Java, it has numerous strong programming features that make it endearing to a number of programmers worldwide.

Asynchronous Programming: C# supports asynchronous programming, enabling the creation of responsive and scalable applications.

Ease of Learning: Its syntax is intuitive and similar to other C-style languages, making it relatively easy for developers to learn and adopt.

C# has gained popularity in software development due to its versatility, developer-friendly syntax, and strong support from Microsoft, making it a valuable tool for building a wide variety of applications.

Cross-platform Development: With .NET Core and .NET 5+, C# allows cross-platform development, expanding its reach beyond Windows to Linux and macOS.

Community and Support: C# has a large and active community, offering support, tutorials, and a wealth of resources for developers.

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

Object-Oriented: C# is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it supports concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Type-Safe: C# is a statically typed language, which means variable types are checked at compile-time, reducing runtime errors.

C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.
What is C#?
C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".

It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 10, was released in November 2021.
You can build native C++ apps for iOS, Android, and Windows devices by using the cross-platform tools available in Visual Studio. Mobile development with C++ is a workload available in the Visual Studio installer.

C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.

C# is used for:

#Is it difficult to learn C#?
Is C# hard to learn? The learning curve for C# is relatively low when compared to more complex languages like Java, although it's not quite as simple to learn as Python, the ultimate programming language for those who are brand new to the field.

Versatility: C# is suitable for building a wide range of applications, from web and desktop to mobile and gaming applications.

Integration with .NET: It seamlessly integrates with the .NET framework, providing access to a vast library of pre-built components and tools.

Strong Typing: C# enforces strong typing, enhancing code reliability and reducing runtime errors.





What is .NET and C sharp?
C# is a programming language and . NET is the framework and runtime that C# programs are built with and run on. C# has a specific syntax. It has rules around keywords, where semicolons go, and how to declare statements. . NET is a framework library that contains thousands of classes for us to use right out of the box
