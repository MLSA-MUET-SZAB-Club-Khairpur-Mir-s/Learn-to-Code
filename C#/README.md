# C# or C sharp
# Basic deep learning tutorials importants points of C#
C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO).
C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.
C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level languages on different computer platforms and architectures.
The following reasons make C# a widely used professional language âˆ’
Although C# constructs closely follow traditional high-level languages, C and C++ and being an object-oriented programming language. It has strong resemblance with Java, it has numerous strong programming features that make it endearing to a number of programmers worldwide.

# What is entrypoint in C#?
C# applications have an entry point called Main Method. It is the first method which gets invoked whenever an application started and it is present in every C# executable file. The application may be Console Application or Windows Application.

Asynchronous Programming: C# supports asynchronous programming, enabling the creation of responsive and scalable applications.

Ease of Learning: Its syntax is intuitive and similar to other C-style languages, making it relatively easy for developers to learn and adopt.

C# has gained popularity in software development due to its versatility, developer-friendly syntax, and strong support from Microsoft, making it a valuable tool for building a wide variety of applications.

Cross-platform Development: With .NET Core and .NET 5+, C# allows cross-platform development, expanding its reach beyond Windows to Linux and macOS.

Community and Support: C# has a large and active community, offering support, tutorials, and a wealth of resources for developers.

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

Object-Oriented: C# is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it supports concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Type-Safe: C# is a statically typed language, which means variable types are checked at compile-time, reducing runtime errors.

C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, games and much more.
What is C#?
C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".

It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 10, was released in November 2021.

C# is used for:
websites
Mobile applications
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web services
Web sites
Games
VR
Database applications
And much, much more
Versatility: C# is suitable for building a wide range of applications, from web and desktop to mobile and gaming applications.

Integration with .NET: It seamlessly integrates with the .NET framework, providing access to a vast library of pre-built components and tools.

Strong Typing: C# enforces strong typing, enhancing code reliability and reducing runtime errors.
